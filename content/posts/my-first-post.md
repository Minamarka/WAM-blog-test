WAM Session — A Web3 recipe for an unstoppable blog on Swarm

In this WAM Session, Igor Shadurin demonstrates how to create an unstoppable blog using a web2 interface and web3 decentralised storage.

In a few simple steps Igor combines his open source project based on the HUGO framework with a generic Ethereum wallet to upload data to the Swarm network. He also leverages forestry.io’s interface to easily manage the newly-created, completely decentralised blog/website.

By combining these tools you can get the best from both worlds. The Swarm network provides secure and private storage that is free of arbitrary editorial policies. Forestry.io, on the other hand, brings a capable and intuitive web2-based user interface to the table that lets you easily style your blog the way you like it.

Tools you will need:

A private key (Igor uses Vanity ETH; you can also use any other private key, for example from a wallet) (free)
A Github account (free)
A Forestry.io account (free)
ENS address (optional, for better-looking URLs)
