WAM Session — A Web3 recipe for an unstoppable blog on Swarm

In this WAM Session, Igor Shadurin demonstrates how to create an unstoppable blog using a web2 interface and web3 decentralised storage.

In a few simple steps Igor combines his open source project based on the HUGO framework with a generic Ethereum wallet to upload data to the Swarm network. He also leverages forestry.io’s interface to easily manage the newly-created, completely decentralised blog/website.

Tools you will need:

A private key (Igor uses Vanity ETH; you can also use any other private key, for example from a wallet) (free)
A Github account (free)
A Forestry.io account (free)
ENS address (optional, for better-looking URLs)
